REGISTERS: all regs are driver names. :) in following order alonso verstappen ricciardo mazepin

OPS: 
target_lap - sets a register to a 3 bit imm -4 <-> 3. Format: <driver> target_lap <imm> (8 bit)
target_plus - adds or subs an imm to the driver -4 <-> 3. Format: <driver> target_plus <imm> (8 bit)
plan - adds or subs driver2 to driver. Format: <driver1> plan <driver2> (7 bits last bit doesnt count)
box_opposite - if the drivers are not equal skip next line. Format: <driver1> box_opposite <driver2> (7 bit last bid useless)
box_box_ - go to relative position line. Format: box_box <imm> -16 <-> 15.
quali_mode - push driver to stack. Format: quali_mode <driver>
cooldown_lap - pop driver from stack. Format: cooldown_lap <driver>. Makes driver = top_of_stack
fia - handles I/O and exit call. Format: fia <imm>  if <imm> = 0 it reads input to alonso
                                                    if <imm> > 0 it prints alonso
                                                    if <imm> < 0 it exits.

NOTICE:
There is no stack_pointer. It only goes off when pushed/popped.

TO RUN:
Write your code in a file (preferably extension .f1l). Go into main.rs and change variable file_name to the file name :skull: and execute main.rs
